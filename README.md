# 5v-headphone-amplifier

A small, op-amp based headphone amplifier with a BOM cost of under Â£10 - think CMOY on steroids. Designed to run from 5V power, specifically cheap single-cell USB powerbanks, where it can be stuck to the side with velcro or double sided tape.

Uses an RC4580D, but any standard footprint SOIC-8 op-amp can be substituted.
